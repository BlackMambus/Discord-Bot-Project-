# Discord-Bot-Project-

ðŸ¤– A Discord Bot is like a tireless digital assistant living inside your serverâ€”it listens, responds, moderates, entertains, and automates tasks so your community runs like clockwork.

ðŸ”§ What Is a Discord Bot?
A custom program (often written in Python, JavaScript, or other languages) that connects to Discordâ€™s API to interact with users and channels automatically. It can:

Respond to commands (e.g., !help, !joke, !play)

Moderate conversations (auto-delete spam, warn users, etc.)

Play music, host games, or show weather updates
